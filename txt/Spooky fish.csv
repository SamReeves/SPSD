It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As soom as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the boys off. Then it pulls away."

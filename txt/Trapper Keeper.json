It became stronger and stronger! Until, by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind  and there was nothing the humons could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything as useless, including humons.  The nations tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothng worked.  The humons built robots of their own, whole armies of them  But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper.

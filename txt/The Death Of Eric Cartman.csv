9060189,906,16,"THE DEATH OF ERIC CARTMAN","BUTTERS","Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this."

9060191,906,17,"THE DEATH OF ERIC CARTMAN","description","Moments later Cartman's hands are shown placing fruits inside a basket, a pair os scissors cutting away at a thick transparent plastic sheet, then the whole basket sealed with a bow. He and Butters grin at the accomplishment. Behind them are some more baskets roady to go. The first basket goes to Principal Victoria. The second goes to Ms. Claridge. The third goes to the rabbi at the synagogue. The congregation there is surprised. The fourth goes to Scott Tenorman, who's sobbing at his parents' graves. Butters and Cartman walk to their next desitnation with another basket as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look on from across the street. They deliver that basket to the abortion clinic. He records the song below, with Butters and a recording engineer in the booth. Next, he and Butters are repairing Mr. Anderson's fence. Cartman hammers the new boards in place as Butters removes the damaged boards. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny appear and watch. Kyle angrily rejects what he's seeing and they walk away. Cartman and Butters then go to the Special Olympics stadium and present a basket to the coordinators. They leave a basket at Sally Struther's door. They're then back in Butters' bedroom and Butters marks off the last atonement."

9060219,906,18,"THE DEATH OF ERIC CARTMAN","DOCTOR","Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests."

9060245,906,21,"THE DEATH OF ERIC CARTMAN","PSYCHIC","Well, many times, the reason that the sould stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event."

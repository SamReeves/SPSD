Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Token presses the pottery wheel pedal as Jordan molds a vase. Butters, Kevin, and another kid work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn't require the use of the pottery wheel."

8100122,810,9,"PRESCHOOL","DR. DOCTOR","From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also appears like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride."

9020076,902,8,"DIE HIPPIE  DIE","CARTMAN","I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this... Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They'er thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival."

9020078,902,8,"DIE HIPPIE  DIE","CARTMAN","Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen."

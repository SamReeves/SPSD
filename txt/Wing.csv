9030001,903,1,"WING","description","South Park Elementary, day. Class is in session. The kids are chattering when Mrs. Garrison gets their attention"
9030002,903,1,"WING","MRS. GARRISON","Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand!"
9030003,903,1,"WING","STAN","Token sings?"
9030004,903,1,"WING","CARTMAN","Of course he sings. He's black."
9030005,903,1,"WING","MRS. GARRISON","Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars."
9030006,903,1,"WING","CLASS","Whoa!"
9030007,903,1,"WING","STAN","Two hundred dollars."
9030008,903,1,"WING","MRS. GARRISON","Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special."
9030009,903,2,"WING","description","South Park Elementary, lunchtime. Stan and friends sit at a table just outside the school kitchen. They're deep in thought"
9030010,903,2,"WING","STAN","Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?"
9030011,903,2,"WING","KYLE","How come we never get opportunities like that?"
9030012,903,2,"WING","CARTMAN","You wanna know what it is, guys?"
9030013,903,2,"WING","KYLE","We're not talented?"
9030014,903,2,"WING","CARTMAN","That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side."
9030015,903,2,"WING","STAN","Yeah. We're too smart to be talented."
9030016,903,2,"WING","CARTMAN","Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star."
9030017,903,2,"WING","KYLE","Probably."
9030018,903,2,"WING","CARTMAN","So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!"
9030019,903,2,"WING","STAN","Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does."
9030020,903,2,"WING","CARTMAN","We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all."
9030021,903,3,"WING","description","MONTAGE Cartman tries out his suit in front of a full-length mirror in his room. Stan and Kyle try out suits in Kyle's room. Next, the boys are in a department store purchasing cell phones at Bull's Eye. Next, Stan and Kyle carry an executive desk into the new office. Next, Cartman and Kenny steal a fountain from somebody's backyard. Next, flyers for the new agency, Super Awesome Talent Agency, are printed out. Next, the boys are at a copy center to get some business cards. Next, Cartman and Kyle set up signs around town. Next, the finished office is shown... in Cartman's basement. The four boys congratulate each other for a job well donw."
9030022,903,4,"WING","description","South Park, day. Token walks by one of the signs the boys drew up. He notices it and stops to read it. The boys hide around the corner. Stan peaks around the corner."
9030023,903,4,"WING","STAN","He's looking at the sign."
9030024,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there."
9030025,903,4,"WING","STAN","All right."
9030026,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk."
9030027,903,4,"WING","KYLE","Why?"
9030028,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit."
9030029,903,4,"WING","STAN","It's genius."
9030030,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!"
9030031,903,4,"WING","TOKEN","Nothin'"
9030032,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night."
9030033,903,4,"WING","TOKEN","Yeah."
9030034,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you."
9030035,903,4,"WING","TOKEN","I'm supposed to be home by 3:30."
9030036,903,4,"WING","CARTMAN","This will only take a second."
9030037,903,5,"WING","description","Cartman's basement - er, Super Awesome Talent Agency. Cartman takes Token down the stairs and onto the agency floor"
9030038,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token. Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client."
9030039,903,5,"WING","STAN","Oohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man."
9030040,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?"
9030041,903,5,"WING","TOKEN","...Yeah?"
9030042,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","Token, the truth is that without representation, you in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now."
9030043,903,5,"WING","KYLE","Can I talk to you?!"
9030044,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","I'll I'll call you back, Abe."
9030045,903,5,"WING","KYLE","What the hell are you doing?!"
9030046,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","I'm making it look like important people call us."
9030047,903,5,"WING","KYLE","Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!"
9030048,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","...well Token doesn't know that."
9030049,903,5,"WING","KYLE","Yes he does!"
9030050,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","How?!"
9030051,903,5,"WING","KYLE","Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!"
9030052,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","Jew!"
9030053,903,5,"WING","STAN","You guys, we're gonna lose our client."
9030054,903,5,"WING","CARTMAN","Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?"
9030055,903,5,"WING","TOKEN","We were at why I should give you ten percent."
9030056,903,5,"WING","STAN","Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can."
9030057,903,5,"WING","KYLE","Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you."
9030058,903,5,"WING","STAN","This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie."
9030059,903,5,"WING","TOKEN","Well, I guess that makes sense. All right."

9030214,903,15,"WING","STAN","You guys, you guys!"
9030215,903,15,"WING","KYLE","What?"
9030216,903,15,"WING","STAN","Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!"
9030217,903,15,"WING","KENNY","(What?!)"

9030220,903,15,"WING","KYLE","Woohoo! Yeah!"
9030221,903,15,"WING","STAN","Yeah!"

9030224,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Who let the dogs out?"
9030225,903,15,"WING","THE BOYS","Who? Who? Who who?"
9030226,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Who let-?"
9030227,903,15,"WING","STAN","Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?"
9030228,903,15,"WING","KYLE","What do you mean? We thought she was with you."
9030229,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Naw, sh-she was with you!"
9030230,903,15,"WING","STAN","...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again."
9030231,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Wing? Wing??"
9030232,903,15,"WING","KYLE","Wing?"
9030233,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Wing? Here, Wing!"
9030234,903,15,"WING","KYLE","Wing?"
9030235,903,15,"WING","KENNY","(Wing?)"
9030236,903,15,"WING","TONG LEADER","You thought you could run from us, did you?"
9030237,903,15,"WING","STAN","Oh no!  Hey! That's our client!"
9030238,903,15,"WING","KYLE","They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!"
9030239,903,15,"WING","CARTMAN","Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back."
9030240,903,16,"WING","description","A crisp clear night under a bright moon. The camera pans down and rests on a hilltop mansion"
9030241,903,16,"WING","TONG LEADER","You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us."
9030242,903,16,"WING","STAN","Two four nine all right, this is the place."
9030243,903,16,"WING","KYLE","Damn, CAA is pretty impressive."
9030244,903,16,"WING","CARTMAN","Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!"
9030245,903,16,"WING","GUARD 1","""It's just four little boys"""
9030246,903,16,"WING","CARTMAN","Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls."
9030247,903,17,"WING","description","The mansion, inside. The boys walk through a long, lavish hallway"
9030248,903,17,"WING","STAN","Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!"
9030249,903,17,"WING","CARTMAN","Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain."
9030250,903,17,"WING","KYLE","You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!"
9030251,903,17,"WING","STAN","You tell 'em, Kyle!"
9030252,903,17,"WING","KYLE","You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!"
9030253,903,17,"WING","STAN","Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!"
9030254,903,17,"WING","TONG LEADER","What the hell is that?! Go! Go!"
9030255,903,17,"WING","KYLE","Dude, maybe we should give up!"
9030256,903,17,"WING","STAN","No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!"
9030257,903,17,"WING","CARTMAN","Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rouch, we can play rought too!"
9030258,903,17,"WING","KYLE","Cartman!"
9030259,903,17,"WING","CARTMAN","Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this!"
9030260,903,17,"WING","STAN","We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!"
9030261,903,17,"WING","KYLE","Wing??"
9030262,903,18,"WING","description","Two guards fire away. Kyle and Kenny duck and cover themselves, and two guards coming up behind them are killed. Cartman and Stan go down a hallway, with Cartman firing at everything in sight. Two guards follow them and fire away. Kyle finds shelter behind a red sofa tattered from the gunfire, but Kenny isn't with him"
9030263,903,18,"WING","KYLE","Stupid talent agents!"
9030264,903,19,"WING","description","Kyle looks up from behind the sofa and throws the car towards the gunmen. One of them slips on it and flies out a window, the other slips on it and falls back onto the mansion's fuse box. He gets electrocuted"
9030265,903,19,"WING","KYLE","All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny? Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!"
9030266,903,20,"WING","description","Kyle hugs Kenny again. Cartman and Stan enter the room where Wing is being held. Cartman again opens fire and three guards fire back. Kyle enters the room with his own gun and fires at the guards"
9030267,903,20,"WING","KYLE","They killed Kenny!"
9030268,903,20,"WING","STAN","You bastards!"
9030269,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out."
9030270,903,20,"WING","CARTMAN","Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!"
9030271,903,20,"WING","STAN","Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!"
9030272,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","This woman has a contract with us! We own her!"
9030273,903,20,"WING","KYLE","She had a contract with us first! We own her!"
9030274,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","Her life belongs to us!"
9030275,903,20,"WING","KYLE","Her life belongs to us!"
9030276,903,20,"WING","STAN","Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of."
9030277,903,20,"WING","KYLE","Yeah."
9030278,903,20,"WING","STAN","Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities."
9030279,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings."
9030280,903,20,"WING","KYLE","Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling."
9030281,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business."
9030282,903,20,"WING","STAN","It's a lousy business. I quit."
9030283,903,20,"WING","KYLE","Me too."
9030284,903,20,"WING","CARTMAN","Aw aw guys, come on!"
9030285,903,20,"WING","TONG LEADER","We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void."
9030286,903,20,"WING","STAN, KYLE","All right!"
9030287,903,21,"WING","description","Stallone's mansion, next day. He gets on stage to ...um, mumble"
9030288,903,21,"WING","PRODUCER","Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing!"
9030289,903,21,"WING","WING","Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long..."

9030291,903,21,"WING","TONG LEADER","Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing."
9030292,903,21,"WING","STAN","I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people."
9030293,903,21,"WING","TOKEN","Send a cress in your plates, folks?"
9030294,903,21,"WING","KYLE","Token?"
9030295,903,21,"WING","TOKEN","Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?"
9030296,903,21,"WING","CARTMAN","Token, you're... waiting tables?"
9030297,903,21,"WING","TOKEN","Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home."
9030298,903,21,"WING","CARTMAN","Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!"
9030299,903,21,"WING","TONG LEADER","My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!"
9030300,903,21,"WING","MR. KIM","Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower."
9030301,903,21,"WING","WING","Sing, sing a song."

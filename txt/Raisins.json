He brightens as she approaches. He turns to greet her, but there's no one to greet. He looks back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling broadly. On the picture are written the words \"I love you forever. Wendy.\" The image fades to black"

If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. \"Hey, cudie.\" When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. \"Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in.\" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. \"I'll be right back with your order, guys.\""

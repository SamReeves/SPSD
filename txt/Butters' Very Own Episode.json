You're a LIAR!\"  \"You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag LIAR!!\"  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me.

Tell us what you know you God-damned LIAR!!\"  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  \"You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!!\"  \"CONFESS!!\"  \"LIAR!!

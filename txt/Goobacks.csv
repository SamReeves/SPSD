8070001,807,1,"GOOBACKS","description","Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. There are two lanes on either side of the highway, with a grass median in between. A Snacky Cakes truck rolls by. Tumbleweeds begin to roll. A few seconds later, the highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is seen until a sphere of energy with a doorway appears. More tumbleweeds roll by. A flash of light follows, and an alien steps forth from the sphere. He looks around and mumbles something. He walks towards the highway, looking around all the while. A car comes up quick on him and he freezes in the headlights for a while, then jumps out of the way as a Busy Beavers Moving Company truck barrels past him. A car comes up on him on the other side of the highway. He gets up quickly and steps out of the way. Traffic picks up and the alien dodges all the vehicles until a car almost runs him over. The car brakes and tips him over."

Indeed, looks like the town has just had a snow storm overnight. Each of the boys carries a shovel. Stan rings the bell. A woman answers."
8070003,807,2,"GOOBACKS","WOMAN","Yes?"
8070004,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?"
8070005,807,2,"GOOBACKS","WOMAN","Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?"
8070006,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!"
8070007,807,2,"GOOBACKS","WOMAN","How about fifteen dollars?"
8070008,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?"
8070009,807,2,"GOOBACKS","KYLE","You've been on your fucking phone since we started!"
8070010,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","Dude, I'm takin' a break."
8070011,807,2,"GOOBACKS","KYLE","A break from what?! You haven't done anything!"
8070012,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers."
8070013,807,2,"GOOBACKS","KYLE","All you ever do is talk about your balls!"
8070014,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?"
8070015,807,2,"GOOBACKS","KYLE","If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!"
8070016,807,2,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!"
8070017,807,3,"GOOBACKS","description","Moments later the doorbell rings again. This time the camera is in the house looking at the door from an angle. The woman approaches and opens the door. The boys are shown, with Cartman keeping his now-bloody nose from oozing any more blood"

8070019,807,3,"GOOBACKS","WOMAN","Oh goodness, what happened?"

8070024,807,3,"GOOBACKS","NEWS ANNOUNCER","This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown."
8070025,807,3,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car."
8070026,807,3,"GOOBACKS","STAN","Whoa."
8070027,807,3,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","Christina Naylon has more."
8070028,807,3,"GOOBACKS","CHRISTINA NAYLON","The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?"
8070029,807,3,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?"
8070030,807,3,"GOOBACKS","BRAD MORGAN","Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Now, uh he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh to find a job here."
8070031,807,3,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?"
8070032,807,3,"GOOBACKS","BRAD MORGAN","Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi-his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundres of dollars, but uh enough, he says, to feed his family."
8070033,807,3,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?"
8070034,807,3,"GOOBACKS","HARRISON MOORE","Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay."
8070035,807,4,"GOOBACKS","description","Later, Stan returns home. He enters with his shovel"
8070036,807,4,"GOOBACKS","STAN","Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!"

8070038,807,4,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time."
8070039,807,4,"GOOBACKS","HARRISON MOORE","Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family."
8070040,807,5,"GOOBACKS","description","Stan's house, night. Sharon puts Stan to bed and tucks him in."

8070042,807,5,"GOOBACKS","STAN","Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em."
8070043,807,5,"GOOBACKS","SHARON","I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie."

Another flash brings forth a third alien. Another flash brings forth his wife, another flash brings forth their daughter, and another flash brings forth their son. Another flash brings forth another alien. They head for the highway, which is busy now. They all make their way across, avoiding being struck as they cross the lanes"

8070050,807,7,"GOOBACKS","CARTMAN","What?? Who??"
8070051,807,7,"GOOBACKS","MRS. LANDIS","One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents."

8070057,807,8,"GOOBACKS","AARON BROWN","Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?"
8070058,807,8,"GOOBACKS","CHRIS HOLT","Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this:  Back to you, Aaron."

Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another.  These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?"

8070193,807,19,"GOOBACKS","STAN","I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better."

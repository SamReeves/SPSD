5080229,508,17,"TOWELIE","KYLE","We're missing out on some quality video game time right now."
5080230,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth"
5080231,508,17,"TOWELIE","STAN","We don't care."
5080232,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly."
5080233,508,17,"TOWELIE","STAN","Dude, we don't care."
5080234,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off."

5080236,508,17,"TOWELIE","KYLE","All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
5080237,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop."
5080238,508,17,"TOWELIE","KYLE","Who's they?"
5080239,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction."
5080240,508,17,"TOWELIE","STAN","Don't care, don't care, don't care."
5080241,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again."

5080243,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base."
5080244,508,17,"TOWELIE","STAN","Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
5080245,508,17,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","You mean to go right into their base? Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan."

5080252,508,18,"TOWELIE","COMMANDER","Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"

5080259,508,19,"TOWELIE","RESEARCH LEADER","I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks."

5080301,508,21,"TOWELIE","COMMANDER","Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret."

I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."

He reaches lever 24. He's then seen at the amusement park with his family, still playing with his PSP, then in ""The Mine Shaft"" roller coaster, where he reaches lever 45. He's seen on the bus playing on his PSP while the other students are having fun, then in Le Bijou playing while Stan and Kyle watch a movie, then on the sidewalk passing some hot babes - he doesn't look up to acknowledge them, then in his bed again at night. He reaches lever 54."

9040031,904,6,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STUART","Hey, I heard that, bitch!"

9040047,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KENNY","(What the fuck is going on?)"
9040048,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","PETER","There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you."
9040049,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KENNY","(Me??)"
9040050,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","PETER","Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massiva attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command."
9040051,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KENNY","(That I what??)"
9040052,904,9,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","PETER","The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe."

9040054,904,10,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 3","Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorgamized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy."
9040055,904,10,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 4","A child? This is God's solution?"

9040057,904,10,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 4","Archangel Michael, what say you?"
9040058,904,10,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","The child did something none of us could: Reach lever sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can singlehandedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves."
9040059,904,11,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","description","Hell. Satan's armies mill about, the troops arm each other. Satan addresses them"
9040060,904,11,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","SATAN","My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault!  You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!"

9040074,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 6","Simple. You will use... this."
9040075,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","This golden PSP is king of all PSPs."
9040076,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGELS","Hail the holy PSP."
9040077,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals."
9040078,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 7","Gabriel returns with news!"
9040079,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","GABRIEL","Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven."
9040080,904,12,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go?"
9040081,904,13,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","description","Hell's Pass Hospital. The paddles have been taken to Kenny and fired away."
9040082,904,13,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","FEMALE NURSE","Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!"
9040083,904,13,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","Then that's it! We brought him back."
9040084,904,13,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MALE NURSE","Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!"
9040085,904,13,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive."

9040087,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again."
9040088,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STUART","It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive."
9040089,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","I'm a-fraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistant meditative staute."""
9040090,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MRS. MCCORMICK","Will he ever recover?"
9040091,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaied once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato."
9040092,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STUART","He can't more on hiw own-ah how will he eat?"
9040093,904,14,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomache. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years."
9040094,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","description","Back in heave, business goes on as usual"
9040095,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","A feeding tube?!"
9040096,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","GABRIEL","Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive."
9040097,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!"
9040098,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","ANGEL 3","The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP's"
9040099,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","GABRIEL","And Satan's armies are approaching."
9040100,904,15,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MICHAEL","Oh God-damnit"
9040101,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","description","A brick building. Inside, a lawyer sees the four boys."

9040106,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","LAWYER","In the highly liekly event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have."
9040107,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Oh wow..."
9040108,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KYLE","That's... really touching."
9040109,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Fag!"
9040110,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","LAWYER","To Eric Cartman: Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."
9040111,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?"
9040112,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","LAWYER","There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,..."
9040113,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Please what?"
9040114,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","LAWYER","I don't know. I lost the last page."
9040115,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?"
9040116,904,16,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","LAWYER","It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours."

9040124,904,17,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","SATAN","I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has."
9040125,904,17,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","SPY ANGEL","Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven."
9040126,904,17,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","SATAB","Then God is helping us.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!"
9040127,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","description","The boys reached Hell's Pass and enter Kenny's recovery room"
9040128,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Kenny??"
9040129,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KYLE","Kenny! You're alive!"
9040130,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Dude, how's you do that??"
9040131,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","He can't responde to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain,"
9040132,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Well... well then he's NOT alive."
9040133,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MRS. MCCORMICK","He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think..."
9040134,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?"
9040135,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STUART","I I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I I just... I don't know what he would want."
9040136,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Yeah, the lawyer lost that page."
9040137,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube."
9040138,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MRS. MCCOMRICK","He did? When?"
9040139,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Um, it was um, this one time..."
9040140,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KYLE","He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!"
9040141,904,18,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that??  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!"

9040158,904,20,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right."
9040159,904,20,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CHIEF JUSTICE","Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here."
9040160,904,20,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF."
9040161,904,20,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","JUDGE 2","Best friends forever?"
9040162,904,20,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is."

9040166,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STUART","Wha, what's the matter, doctor?"
9040167,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","THE DOCTOR","I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube."
9040168,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","MRS. MCCORMICK","What?"
9040169,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CARTMAN","He's right in here."

9040171,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CHIEF JUSTICE","Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish."

9040173,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","POLICE OFFICER","Sir, take a look at this."
9040174,904,21,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","CHIEF JUSTICE","That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor."

9040181,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","STAN","Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he he's gonna die for sure!"
9040182,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","GABRIEL","The tube has been removed?"
9040183,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KYLE","How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?"
9040184,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","URIEL","Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us."
9040185,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","GABRIEL","Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time."
9040186,904,22,"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER","KYLE","Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!"

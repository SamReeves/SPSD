6160183,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys."
6160184,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","What the hell are you doing here?!"
6160185,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?"

6160187,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go."
6160188,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?"
6160189,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!"
6160190,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've beenhelping children get back at their parents ever since."
6160191,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!"
6160192,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business hre with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you."
6160193,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol."
6160194,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?"
6160195,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Yeah!"
6160196,616,19,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way."

6160203,616,20,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","DIRECTOR","Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking."
6160204,616,20,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","SHARON","Well that makes sense."
6160205,616,20,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","DIRECTOR","So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. Or that... one pill of Ecstacy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means."

Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop."
6160209,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore."

6160212,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents."
6160213,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?"
6160214,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Now, personally, I like the baby green. But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house."
6160215,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best."
6160216,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom."
6160217,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Well that sounds good."
6160218,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice."
6160219,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","BUTTERS","Hooray!"
6160220,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school."
6160221,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","Yeah."
6160222,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office."
6160223,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","Yeah."
6160224,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place."

6160232,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","STAN","Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!"
6160233,616,21,"MY FUTURE SELF N ME","CARTMAN","Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog"

6040402,604,38,"FUN WITH VEAL","OFFICER BARBRADY","What you do mean?"
6040403,604,38,"FUN WITH VEAL","RANCHER BOB","You see, in the six days since the word ""veal"" was officially changed to ""little tortured baby cow"" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see ""little tortured baby cow"" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'."
6040404,604,38,"FUN WITH VEAL","BUTTERS","Really?"
6040405,604,38,"FUN WITH VEAL","RANCHER BOB","Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life."

6040409,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","RANDY","Vaginitis?"
6040410,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","DR. DOCTOR","It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy."
6040411,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","KYLE","Whoa, dude."
6040412,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","DR. DOCTOR","We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading."
6040413,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","CARTMAN","Thank God we stopped it in time."
6040414,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","STAN","Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas."
6040415,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","BUTTERS","Hear hear."
6040416,604,39,"FUN WITH VEAL","KYLE'S MOTHER","All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start."

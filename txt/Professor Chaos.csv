6060005,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go."
6060006,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Butters, could you take a seat, please?"
6060007,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Wuh well, sure."

6060009,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Wull what is it?"
6060010,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."""
6060011,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend."
6060012,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out."
6060013,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Nnnot working out?"

6060016,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Lane, yes."
6060017,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Well, but ah I can get better."
6060018,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN","Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunites elsewhere."
6060019,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were."
6060020,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together."
6060021,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Yes, well, we weren't."
6060022,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Please, fellas, uh don't fire me."
6060023,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","We're sorry Butters.  Our mind is made up."
6060024,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right?"
6060025,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","Phew."
6060026,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN, CARTMAN","Phew."
6060027,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think."
6060028,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Who cares?"
6060029,606,1,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN","All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place."
6060030,606,2,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Butters' house, night. A thunderstorm hovers over the neighborhood. Inside Butters' room a hamster set is seen, and beyond, Butters standing on his bed, looking out his window. He has an angry expression on his face"
6060031,606,2,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow!"
6060032,606,3,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Butters goes about making a suit for himself. He begins with a sheet of aluminum foil and shapes it around a styrofoam head to make a helmet. He pulls out a shirt from the closet and makes it a cape using a sewing machine. Pretty soon, he's finished - he's dressed as something of a knight"
6060033,606,3,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos!"
6060034,606,3,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","LINDA","Butters, time for bed."
6060035,606,3,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins."
6060036,606,4,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","South Park, morning. A small stage is shown in Cartman'ss backyard, with a camera off to the side. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up on stage and look out over the backyard"
6060037,606,4,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?"
6060038,606,4,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CLYDE","...What if we don't want to be your friend?"
6060039,606,4,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee."
6060040,606,5,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","South Park, later. The camera looks at the end of Main Street, and Butters comes over a bump on the street. He heads towards the camera right in the middle of the street as the adults around him talk or window-shop. He walks on, and a Bennigan's appears to his left. He turns to look at it, then runs through the front doors. He stops just inside. The diners go about eating and chatting. A waitress serves a table"
6060041,606,5,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BENNIGAN'S CHEF","Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up."
6060042,606,6,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Butters sees the dishes and walks up to them. He stares at them for a few seconds, then switches them, grinning evilly. He then drops down quickly as a waitress comes for the dishes. She delivers them to the two diners who ordered them"
6060043,606,6,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","MAN 1","Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone."
6060044,606,6,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","MAN 2","Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here."
6060045,606,6,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uhwill bow down to me!"
6060046,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Montage 1 - A Day At The Amusement Park."
6060047,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN","So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great."
6060048,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy."
6060049,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","JIMMY","Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?"
6060050,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend."
6060051,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","TWEEK","What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!"
6060052,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","DOG POO","I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything."
6060053,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop."
6060054,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","Towelie is a tough choice because, even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high."
6060055,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","TOWELIE","Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on."
6060056,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and..."
6060057,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","JIMMY","Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas."
6060058,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","RIDE OPERATOR","O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance."
6060059,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points."
6060060,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes."
6060061,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","JIMMY","Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?"
6060062,606,7,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN","One thing for sure: picking our new freidn isn't gonna be easy."
6060063,606,8,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","South Park, day. Butters is still dressed as Professor Chaos, still walking down the street. A dog walks across the street and Butters stops next to it."
6060064,606,8,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!"
6060065,606,9,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Butters' house, later. He makes it to his room and locks the door. He cackles again"
6060066,606,9,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning!"
6060067,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","description","Cartman's backyard, day. All the kids are seated as they were yesterday. A box of roses sites on stage."
6060068,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?"
6060069,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","KYLE","Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy"

6060076,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","CARTMAN","All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!"

6060078,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","DOUGIE","I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!"
6060079,606,10,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","STAN","All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck."

6060100,606,14,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","BUTTERS","Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer!"
6060101,606,14,"PROFESSOR CHAOS","MS. CHOKSONDIK","No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five."

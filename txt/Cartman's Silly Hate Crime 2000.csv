4020292,402,21,"CARTMAN S SILLY HATE CRIME","STAN","Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
4020293,402,21,"CARTMAN S SILLY HATE CRIME","KYLE","But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."

5060181,506,14,"CARTMANLAND","CARTMAN","Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go."

5060195,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","NURSE","Just a little more  There we go."
5060196,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?"
5060197,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","Awesome."
5060198,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","Kyle, we wanna tell you about the book of Job. It's a story from the Bible."
5060199,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?"
5060200,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay. You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends."
5060201,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor."
5060202,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God."
5060203,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","But one day, Satan went up to heaven and talked to God."
5060204,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","Satan talked to God?"
5060205,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","Yes, in the book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, ""Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."""
5060206,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."""
5060207,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","To which God said, ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."""
5060208,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers."
5060209,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees."
5060210,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all."
5060211,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,"" and praised God's name."
5060212,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","So then, Job got painful sores all over his body."
5060213,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith."
5060214,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","God said to Sata, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."""
5060215,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","And that's it? That's the end?"
5060216,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S MOTHER","Basically."
5060217,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?"
5060218,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE'S FATHER","Oh. Uhhh, I don't know."
5060219,506,15,"CARTMANLAND","KYLE","Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God."

5060228,506,17,"CARTMANLAND","HOST 2","And the way he did it is with the brilliant ""You Can't Come"" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing."

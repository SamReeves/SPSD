2100002,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","But what's wrong with her?"
2100003,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","DR. DOCTOR","It's chicken pox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chicken pox as a little child, I take it?"
2100004,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","No, uh-no, she's been perfectly healthy."
2100005,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","DR. DOCTOR","Well, that's the problem. You see, chicken pox is a pretty normal thing for young children. But as you get older it becomes more and more a- ferocious disease."
2100006,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","Shelley, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan."
2100007,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHELLEY","Oh, whoo-peee!"
2100008,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","DR. DOCTOR","You know, most people don't realize that chicken pox is actually a form of herpes."
2100009,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","STAN","Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
2100010,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHELLEY","Shut up, brat!"
2100011,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","Will my daughter be okay?"
2100012,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","DR. DOCTOR","She'll be fine."
2100013,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","SHELLEY","Stop it!"
2100014,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","DR. DOCTOR","We just want to be cautious and monitor her here."
2100015,210,1,"CHICKEN POX","STAN","OOOWWW!"

2100018,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die."
2100019,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","KYLE'S MOTHER","My God, I never knew chicken pox was such a dangerous illness."
2100020,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","LIANE","I guess it's much better to get it when you're young."
2100021,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chicken pox. Let them get it now, while they're young."
2100022,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","KYLE'S MOTHER","That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time."
2100023,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","LIANE","Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chicken pox, just so I would get it."
2100024,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","SHARON","So it's not such a crazy idea after all?"
2100025,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","KYLE'S MOTHER","Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chicken pox right now."
2100026,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","KYLE","Are you guys having a meeting or something?"
2100027,210,2,"CHICKEN POX","KYLE'S MOTHER","How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?"

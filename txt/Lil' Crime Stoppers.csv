7060003,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar."
7060004,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CHRIS","Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now."
7060005,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Awww, shit!"

7060008,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?"
7060009,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea."
7060010,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it."
7060011,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD WOMAN","Oh, hello there boys."
7060012,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?"

7060014,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Really?"
7060015,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD WOMAN","Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone."
7060016,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","My God..."
7060017,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Have you reported this to any other authorities?"
7060018,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD WOMAN","Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids."
7060019,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am."
7060020,706,1,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","We're on the case."

7060023,706,2,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Detective McCormick found something interesting."
7060024,706,2,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Jesus, we're too late."
7060025,706,2,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","I think we can piece this case together now."
7060026,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","description","The old woman's house, living room. She and her husband sit back in arm chairs looking at news. The door opens and the boys rush in with the pie tin"
7060027,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD WOMAN","My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?"
7060028,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory."
7060029,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD MAN","Well, what do you thnk happened, little detectives?"
7060030,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody."
7060031,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet."
7060032,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Slowly the rage built inside his mind. ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!"
7060033,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","His plan was to use a hammer."
7060034,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death."
7060035,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head."
7060036,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Then saw off the arms and legs."
7060037,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","The torso he would dump into the lake."
7060038,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub."
7060039,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie."
7060040,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog."
7060041,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Looks like the game is over, old man!"
7060042,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","OLD WOMAN","Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??"
7060043,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Just the news."

7060047,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!"
7060048,706,3,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","We're in business!"
7060049,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","description","A basement, some time later. The dollar bill is newly framed and hung on a wall in ... Cartman's basement, which is now the South Park Detectives headquarters. Pictures of suspects are on the wall below the framed dollar, a chalkboard has some instructions listed, and some suspects already interviewed are listed on the wall beneath the stairs. Kyle puts a file away in a filing cabinet as the other boys do other tasks."
7060050,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington"
7060051,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","LIANE","Boys, you have a little visitor."

7060055,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","GIRL","I lost my dollie."
7060056,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!"
7060057,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Do you kow where your doll is?"
7060058,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","GIRL","If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost."
7060059,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny."
7060060,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","SARAH","She has curly blonde hair. And a red dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair."
7060061,706,4,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","You got it, Ken?"

7060067,706,5,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","But the window isn't locked."
7060068,706,5,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","STAN","Right, so it's possible that the theif sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure."
7060069,706,5,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","KYLE","Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brough a shovel to decapitate it."
7060070,706,5,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","CARTMAN","We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room."
7060071,706,5,"LIL  CRIME STOPPERS","A BOY","All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell,  give me smears of all the places the doll used to be!  Mitchell, run a tap on the phone!"

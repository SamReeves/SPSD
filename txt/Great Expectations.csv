Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, ""Great Expectations""  And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents."

4140128,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havesham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth."
4140129,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","PIP","Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!"
4140130,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havesham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler."
4140131,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","PIP","Sorry! Sorry!"
4140132,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!"
4140133,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","PIP","Oh. Excuse me."
4140134,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havesham received 20 minutes before the wedding."
4140135,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","PIP","At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house."
4140136,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table."
4140137,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","PIP","Terribly sorry, Pocket,"
4140138,414,13,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure!"

4140140,414,14,"GREAT EXPECTATIONS","A BRITISH PERSON","And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella."

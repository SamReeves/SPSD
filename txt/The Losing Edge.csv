9050208,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","KYLE","Dude, what are we gonna do?? We can't win this game."
9050209,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","CARTMAN","Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team."
9050210,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","CLYDE","Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears."
9050211,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","CARTMAN","Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass."
9050212,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","STAN","Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win."
9050213,905,20,"THE LOSING EDGE","CRAIG","But who?"

9050218,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","KYLE","There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play."
9050219,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","KYLE 1","Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas."
9050220,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","KYLE","Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team."
9050221,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","KYLE 1","Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses."
9050222,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","CRAIG","He's perfect."
9050223,905,21,"THE LOSING EDGE","STAN","Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance."
9050224,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","description","Coors Field. No one is in there except Randy, who walks along the stands looking around. He sees a sign that sais ""Colorado Little League State Championship."" He moves along. Next, he's at a beach far from Colorado looking at the sunset. He sneaks back into his bedroom as Sharon sleeps, closes the door softly, and sits on the side of the bed."

9050230,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","SHARON","You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-?"
9050231,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","RANDY","Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon."
9050232,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","SHARON","So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!"
9050233,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","RANDY","Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am."
9050234,905,22,"THE LOSING EDGE","SHARON","No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself."

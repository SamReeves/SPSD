5130012,513,2,"KENNY DIES","DOCTOR","Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies"

5130185,513,22,"KENNY DIES","LARRY","Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat?

5130187,513,22,"KENNY DIES","LARRY","Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells."
5130188,513,22,"KENNY DIES","CARTMAN","So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? Ihin other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue."
5130189,513,22,"KENNY DIES","LARRY","That's the theory."
5130190,513,22,"KENNY DIES","CARTMAN","Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!"
5130191,513,22,"KENNY DIES","LARRY","Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber."
5130192,513,22,"KENNY DIES","CARTMAN","Hmmm."
5130193,513,22,"KENNY DIES","LARRY","But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know."

5130234,513,24,"KENNY DIES","STAN","Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?"
5130235,513,24,"KENNY DIES","CHEF","Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes.Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand."
5130236,513,24,"KENNY DIES","STAN","But then, why does God give us anything to start with?"
5130237,513,24,"KENNY DIES","CHEF","Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power."

All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.

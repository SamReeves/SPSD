8030173,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","KYLE","Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over."
8030174,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","FR. MAXI","...What is troubling you, my child?"
8030175,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","KYLE","Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it ...so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord."
8030176,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","FR. MAXI","Ah! You mean he's a Jew!"
8030177,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","KYLE","Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night."
8030178,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","FR. MAXI","Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews."
8030179,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","KYLE","But how can the Jews make it better??"
8030180,803,17,"THE PASSION OF THE JEW","FR. MAXI","Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about... atonement."

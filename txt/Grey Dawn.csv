7100002,710,2,"GREY DAWN","description","Day. A crowd is gathered under this banner and listens to Father Maxi as he delivers a service."
7100003,710,2,"GREY DAWN","FATHER MAXI","Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver."
7100004,710,2,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring."
7100005,710,2,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!"
7100006,710,2,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly"
7100007,710,2,"GREY DAWN","FATHER MAXI","It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again."

7100202,710,24,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!"
7100203,710,24,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!"
7100204,710,24,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Dad, what are you doing??"

7100212,710,24,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?"
7100213,710,24,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","Heh??  No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!"
7100214,710,24,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before morp people get hurt>"
7100215,710,24,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!"

7100217,710,25,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station."

7100232,710,26,"GREY DAWN","description","Nighttime, the drive-in. All adults who are not senior citizens have been gathered into an enclosure around the massive screen. Two seniors stand guard at the gates, other seniors keep the adults in line. The adults are cold. Some cough, some try to keep warm by burning tires inside empty gas drums. Randy is one of those warming his hands over a fire. He moans. The boys arrive, having not been arrested"
7100233,710,26,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Hey Dad."
7100234,710,26,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Stan! Boys! You're safe!"
7100235,710,26,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?"
7100236,710,26,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!"
7100237,710,26,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","They're saying something about taking over the entire country."
7100238,710,26,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!"
7100239,710,26,"GREY DAWN","STAN","No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?"
7100240,710,26,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","No, son. We... like to sleep in."
7100241,710,26,"GREY DAWN","AN ELDERLAY WOMAN","Two hostages come front and center!"
7100242,710,26,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!"
7100243,710,27,"GREY DAWN","description","The woods. The boys have set up a little camp there for the night."
7100244,710,27,"GREY DAWN","STAN","All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office."
7100245,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","So our only solution is to cut off their life force."
7100246,710,27,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","We can't fight them, Cartman."
7100247,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here."
7100248,710,27,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","Country Kitchen Buffet?"
7100249,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do."
7100250,710,27,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
7100251,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week."
7100252,710,27,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Yeah, I remember hearing about that."
7100253,710,27,"GREY DAWN","KYLE","Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?"
7100254,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them we send him inside."
7100255,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Yeah!"
7100256,710,27,"GREY DAWN","STAN","All right!"
7100257,710,27,"GREY DAWN","KENNY","(Woohoo!)"
7100258,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Aw yeah!"
7100259,710,27,"GREY DAWN","STAN","We did it!"
7100260,710,27,"GREY DAWN","STAN","...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in."
7100261,710,27,"GREY DAWN","CARTMAN","Well, right, or we could always do that."
7100262,710,28,"GREY DAWN","description","South Park, day. The old people have the run of the town, and they're bringing in heavier artillery"
7100263,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!"
7100264,710,28,"GREY DAWN","AARP MEMBERS","All right!"
7100265,710,28,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back."
7100266,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","Huh??  Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!"
7100267,710,28,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?"
7100268,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2!  What the heck?  Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!"
7100269,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY MAN 9","It's not open? It has to be!"
7100270,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY MAN 10","Try a window."
7100271,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY MAN 11","They're blocked from the inside."
7100272,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","No...  Let us in! Let us in!"
7100273,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY MAN 9","Open the door! It's six a.m."
7100274,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY WOMAN","Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!"
7100275,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ELDERLY MAN","You have to let us in!"
7100276,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ARMY OFFICIAL","All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages. That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country."
7100277,710,28,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?"
7100278,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ARMY OFFICIAL","Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks."
7100279,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STEWART","Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?"
7100280,710,28,"GREY DAWN","SOLDIER","Sir, what should we do with this one?"
7100281,710,28,"GREY DAWN","ARMY OFFICIAL","It's up to the townspeople."
7100282,710,28,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does."
7100283,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!"
7100284,710,28,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Huh?"
7100285,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it."
7100286,710,28,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","That's right."
7100287,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STAN","And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine."
7100288,710,28,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families."
7100289,710,28,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home."
7100290,710,28,"GREY DAWN","MARVIN","Sure. I'll drive."
7100291,710,28,"GREY DAWN","RANDY","That's our Grandpa."
7100292,710,28,"GREY DAWN","STAN","Dude, I hate my family."

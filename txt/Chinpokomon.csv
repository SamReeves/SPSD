3110403,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","No.  Screw this, dude."
3110404,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","CARTMAN","Where are you going, Stan?"
3110405,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something."
3110406,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","CARTMAN","Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes."
3110407,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","OTHER KIDS","Yeah. Me too! Me too."
3110408,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","PRESIDENT HIROHITO","Ooooh!"
3110409,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","RANDY","Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
3110410,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","SHARON","That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison! Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down!"
3110411,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
3110412,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","SHARON","You bet, Stanley!"
3110413,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","Owatta Beikoku!"
3110414,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE'S MOTHER","Kyle, it's over!"
3110415,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!"
3110416,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
3110417,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","What?"
3110418,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","CARTMAN","Yeah, dude, that's way over."
3110419,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
3110420,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
3110421,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?"
3110422,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","...Ye-eah."
3110423,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya."
3110424,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","STAN","Oh. Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
3110425,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","Aw, screw it; I'm too confused."
3110426,311,24,"CHINPOKOMON","RANDY","Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."

3110429,311,25,"CHINPOKOMON","CARTMAN","Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!"
3110430,311,25,"CHINPOKOMON","RANDY","Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
3110431,311,25,"CHINPOKOMON","KYLE","Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
3110432,311,25,"CHINPOKOMON","CARTMAN","Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-"

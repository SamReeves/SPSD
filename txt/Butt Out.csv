7130128,713,9,"BUTT OUT","ROB REINER","Not if I were around, they wouldn't have."
7130129,713,9,"BUTT OUT","KEVIN HARRIS","Escuse me?"

7130131,713,9,"BUTT OUT","KEVIN HARRIS","The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports."
7130132,713,9,"BUTT OUT","KYLE","So, tobacco helped to build America."
7130133,713,9,"BUTT OUT","KEVIN HARRIS","That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields."
7130134,713,9,"BUTT OUT","CARTMAN","Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today."
7130135,713,9,"BUTT OUT","KEVIN HARRIS","And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965, when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about."

The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??"

7130227,713,15,"BUTT OUT","STAN","Oh all right."
7130228,713,15,"BUTT OUT","KYLE","No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded."
7130229,713,15,"BUTT OUT","STAN","Why?"
7130230,713,15,"BUTT OUT","KYLE","Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!"
7130231,713,15,"BUTT OUT","STAN","So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks."

7130238,713,16,"BUTT OUT","COUNSELOR MACKEY","Wait a minute, what?"
7130239,713,16,"BUTT OUT","ROB REINER","Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it!"
7130240,713,16,"BUTT OUT","RANDY","Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right."
7130241,713,16,"BUTT OUT","ROB REINER","Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!"
7130242,713,16,"BUTT OUT","KYLE","No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it."
7130243,713,16,"BUTT OUT","STAN","Yup."
7130244,713,16,"BUTT OUT","KYLE","You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!"
